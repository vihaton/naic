Current state-of-the-art image classification methods need thousands of examples and iterations to learn accurate and reliable representations of visual categories. However, humans are able to acquire new categories relying on just a small number of examples.

We are going to address this gap by incorporating human cognitive inference mechanisms into the machine learning methods of image classification to make them able to learn quickly and reliably. In particular, we expect that human-like assumption of speaker's informativeness will help machines to successfully represent a visual category basing on just several images, accompanied by natural language descriptions.
